## Background Subtraction 
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to perform background subtraction on a video using the OpenCV library. 
It uses the cv2 module to process frames from a video file and apply background subtraction techniques.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library

## Customization

You can change the input video file by replacing 'red_car_moving.mp4' with the path to your video file.
Modify the parameters of the background subtractor (cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()) according to your needs.
Adjust the values of the bounding rectangle and the rectangle color ((0, 0, 255)) to fit your desired output.
